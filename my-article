Automating User Management with Bash Scripting
In a growing organization, managing user accounts efficiently is crucial for maintaining security and accessibility. As a SysOps engineer, I was tasked with automating the process of creating user accounts for new developers using a bash script on Ubuntu Linux. This script reads from a text file containing Yoruba names as usernames and their associated groups, creates the users and groups, assigns passwords, and logs all actions for auditing purposes.

Script Overview
The `create_users.sh` script automates the following tasks:
    1. R eading Input: It reads usernames and associated groups from a specified text file. 
    2. User and Group Creation: For each line in the input file, it creates a user with a home directory and assigns them to their specified primary and secondary groups.
    3. Password Generation: A random password is generated securely for each user and set using `chpasswd`.
    4. Logging: All actions performed by the script are logged in `/var/log/user_management.log`.
    5. Password Storage: Generated passwords are stored securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`, accessible only to the file owner.

Implementation Details
The script ensures error handling for scenarios like existing users and invalid input formats. Each step is carefully designed to adhere to best practices in user management and security protocols.

Example Usage
To use the script, simply provide a text file containing usernames and groups formatted as `username;groups`, where groups are comma-separated. Here's an example:

```
ade;developers
bolu;developers,admin
dayo;admin
```
